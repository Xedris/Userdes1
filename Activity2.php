<h1 style="color:Lime;"> 1st application</h1>
<p1 style="color:Lime;"> I have two favorite applications, the first would have to be game master 5 because it’s the main
tool I use when I play with my friends. I like using this app because it has all the tools I need to create
and control our DnD games. It has all the items and rules already installed in it and it allows us to keep
track of our own characters as well.</p1>

<h2 style="color:Lime;"> 2nd application</h2>
<p2 style="color:Lime;">My 2nd favorite application is spotify because it has a large collection of music from many different
genres and artists. This is one of my favorite apps because during my free time or when I’m on the road I
love to listen to music to pass the time. One of the main downsides though about spotify is that you
must listen through advertisements not unless you buy the premium version but overall it’s a very good
music application.</p2>

<h3 style="color:Lime;"> 3rd application</h3>
<p3 style="color:Lime;">Dropbox would have to be my third favorite application because it’s a quick and easy file sharing
application. It allows me and others to upload important files online that way even if we lose the original
copy its saved online for future use. It also allows us to share those files with other people and they can
add their own files to it so they can share it with you</p3>

<h4 style="color:Lime;"> 4th application</h4>
<p4 style="color:Lime;">Facebook is my fourth favorite app because it’s an easy way for me to pass the time when I have
nothing to do plus, I can see what my friends have shared and react to what they posted. It’s also a way
for us to comment on the posts and it can them to comment back to us.</p4>

<h5 style="color:Lime;"> 5th application</h5>
<p5 style="color:Lime;"> Fate Grand Order is my last favorite app because it’s a good way for me to pass the time and even
though it seems simple the game is quite difficult when the challenge quests come around because you
have to plan your team and how to use them to their fullest. I also love the art style they use in the
game because they have all their own distinct way of looking. The story is also something that has
interested me because it isn’t something normally seen.</p5>
