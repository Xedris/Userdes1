  <p> <b>How can we improve this?</b> <br>
    a. One of the things that you can do to improve the invitation is to get rid of word<br>
    "delectable" from the wording since its used to describe food more instead of an event<br>
    b. You can also specify the location more since "The Pad" is very vague and could be a location<br>
    anywhere or it could be an inside joke between them<br>
    c. The when and where is located in the wrong place and there should already be a space for both<br>
    <br>
    2. What is the Objective Function?<br>
    The Objective Function is to be an invitation to close friends or colleagues to an after dinner part<br>
    hosted by Robert and Alexandria</p>
