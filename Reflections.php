<h1 style="color:Lime;"> Reflection 1</h1>
<p1 style="color:Lime;"> The first week of the class was actually quite surprising since I didn’t expect to be using trello, 
I didn’t even know trello was a thing at first until Ms showed it to us. As for the activities I liked doing them since it allows us 
to express ourselves. I liked doing the one that asked us to talk about or favorite app since I like to talk about the features each
one gives and uses. For the teacher I like the way Ms is doing the class but only doing activities is a bit weird but I think I can 
adjust well.</p1>

<h2 style="color:DeepPink;"> Reflection 2 </h2>
<p2 style="color:DeepPink;">My reflection about the 2nd week of the class is that things are moving too fast and that there is 
almost no time to understand everything. There is also to many things to use at the same time especially Heroku since it’s hard to 
use and understand. But as for the activities itself they are fun to do especially with how we must solve the problems. As for the 
class itself it’s still nice to code but all the continous work is starting to bog us down.</p2>

<h3 style="color:LightGreen;"> Reflection 3</h3>
<p3 style="color:LightGreen;">So the moment ms gave us the Lab 1 activity I was excited to do it because it was something I haven’t done 
in a long time and it was something I used to do before when I was in 3rd year highschool. When we all learned that we had to upload 
the HTML into both heroku and github it was actually confusing on how to make heroku work especially since for so long we’ve been using
only Github for our work and heroku was brand new for us to work with. I actually was starting to think that heroku was busted or 
something since it had no user manual to use but once we got it to work it was actually easy to understand more or less</p3>

<h4 style="color:MediumOrchid;"> Reflection 4</h4>
<p4 style="color:MediumOrchid;">After the lesson when talking about personas and UI I really did not care much about what went on in the UI
since I only cared about if it was useful or not. Even now I only care if the UI is simple enough to use and navigate for me.</p4>
