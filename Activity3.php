<h1 style="color:RosyBrown;"> 1st application</h1>
<p1 style="color:RosyBrown;">The first thing I would do to create an Elevator for a building with 1000 floors would be to think of how 
the elevator would be able to traverse each floor. The solution would be having 3 main gears in the system, each gear would have to 
correspond with a number placement. 1 gear would be for the ones position, the 2nd gear for the tens position and the last gear would 
be for the hundreds position and the 1000th floor..</p1>
  <h2></h2>
<p2 style="color:RosyBrown;">For how people would choose which floor to go to, instead of the conventional buttons for each floor because 
it would be a hassle to have 1000 buttons for each floor, it would be more convenient to install a digital numpad for use. The digital 
numpad would be easier to use in the elevator allowing people to just input the floor number on the touchpad and if they decide not to
go to that floor and want to change it, there would be a second screen right next to numpad that would show a list of the floors that 
have already been inputted and if they want to cancel that floor all they have to do is select it and there would be a pop-up that 
would appear asking if they want to cancel that floor. As for people who want to get on to an elevator and they want to know which
floor the elevator is on there would be another screen on the outside below the elevator call buttons, which would show what direction
the elevator is going, what floor it is currently on and which floors have been inputted and what the next floor is.</p2>
  <h3></h3>
<p3 style="color:RosyBrown;"> Since the elevator is for a building with 1000 floors itâ€™s obvious that one elevator alone is not enough
to accommodate the entire building, I would have 5 different sets of elevators situated in the North, South, East and West side of the 
building and the last set of elevators would be in the very center of the building. Each set is equivalent to 7 elevators so in all there
would be 35 elevators in the entire Building. As for the elevator itself, instead of the usual elevator used for malls and condominiums,
it would instead be a dover hyrdraulic freight elevator, the reason for this would be because there would be possibly over a thousand
people in the building it would be much more convenient to use a freight elevator because it would be able to handle the larger amount
of people and the added weight to it. As for the design of the elevator's interior because it is a freight elevator it would allow for 
the addition of benches along the rails and creating a sort of aisle system inside the elevator, for PWD there would be a special
designated area. There would also be a first aid kit put into each corner of the elevator for emergencies. To help people pass the 
time there would be music playing inside the elevator for each person to use, and most importantly there would be a wifi router installed 
in each elevator to allowing each person to connect and pass the time more efficiently especially for the higher most floors where cell
signal would start to disappear</p3>
