<h1 style="color:Lime;"> 1st application</h1>
<p1 style="color:Lime;"> I have two favorite applications, the first would have to be game master 5 because itâ€™s the main
tool I use when I play with my friends. I like using this app because it has all the tools I need to create
and control our DnD games. It has all the items and rules already installed in it and it allows us to keep
track of our own characters as well.</p1>
