<h2 style="color:Lime;"> Persona 1</h2>
<p1 style="color:Lime;"> Dwayne is a student here in Asia Pacific College. He spends lots of his time working on his projects in 
  his engineering class, and for the past few days, he’s been feeling rather loaded with work and exams. Now that exams are over, 
  he wants to spend some quality time with his friends after classes. 
He then remembers his friend telling him about the Gaming Laboratory on the 5th floor, and that they should pay a visit one day. 
  He checks his schedule and sees that he’s free to visit with his group later in the afternoon, but is unsure if the lab is available.
Dwayne asks one of his professors, Sir Isaac, about the lab’s hours, to which he is told of the new web application that allows users to
  set schedules and activities. He finds a slot that fits his schedule, and arrives with his friends at the appointed time to see some 
  others in the room. They find their reserved place and begin gaming.
